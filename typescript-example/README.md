# TypeScript Example

This is the same Task List (To-Do) app, but written in TypeScript.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Run `npm install` and then `npm start` in this folder, or open `index.html` after compiling.

## What to Observe
- Type annotations and interfaces for safety.
- Errors are caught at compile time.
- Improved developer experience with autocompletion and refactoring.
